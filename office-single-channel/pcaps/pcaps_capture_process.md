# remote_capture.pcap
contains mostly association packets, it was generated by having the physical interfaces up, and putting the virtual interface down, then the capture starts and the interface is rised with this command "ip link set wlan1-ap up" 

# remote_capture_netperf.pcap 
contains the traffic from a netperf execution

# file names
Associantions where captured with 
```
ssh root@thisnode.info "tcpdump -i mon1 -w -" > remote_capture
```
And traffic from netfperf 
```
ssh root@thisnode.info "tcpdump -i mon1 -w -" > remote_capture_netperf.pcap
```
In ap mode also statistics form other interfaces where captured 

remote_capture_netperf.pcap equivalent files show some estrange sequences witch differ from the same from APU vs classic ap mode. APuP mode appears to have "[TCP ACKed unseen segment]" flags, also shows numerous acknowledgements in sequence from the same device, Primarily Acknowledgement frames are seen, with occasional Clear-to-send frames.
